#### A prototype canvas interface


## Purpose

I wanted to build a canvas interface/abstraction and I felt this might be an interesting approach


## Should you use this

No. I've spent like 2 hours on it so far.

## Who is this for?

Me.

## Why should I trust you? Maybe this is the greatest canvas abstraction of all time.

If you look at this code and think "this is awesome"... I have a bridge to sell you.


## Licence

MIT (because honestly if you decide to use this... it's really at your own peril)
